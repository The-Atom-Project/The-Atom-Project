## About Us

A fork of lineageOS to provide extra features and community wants.

## Todo List

- [ ] Built in integration with an equaliser such as wavelet/Jamesdsp.
- [ ] Dark screen filter slider to lower the brightness of your display even more.
- [ ] Built in theme selctor/maker, all customized with scss and json condig files. **that can also be imported/exported as a standalone .zip file.
- [ ] Screen off sensor/radio killswitch (togglable in settings) (and may have a quick settings shortcut)
- [ ] Double click volume rocker to skip or go back a song.
- [ ] App Auto sorter (app menu) (by letter, by genre of app, by most used etc) (maybe add custom swipe gestures ie swipe up center will reveal apps organized by letter, swipe up left will reveal the genres of apps ie games social media etc, swipe up right will open most used apps)
